Squat down, then immediately explode upwards in a diagnonal direction over the cone i na directio ntowards the 2nd cone (with a minimal pause in the squat position). Your jump should push through your the heels of your feet and extend your hips, knees and ankles in one movement. Swinging your arms upwards as you jump will increase your power and jumping ability.
Maintain your foot alignment during the jump, landing with your feet aligned in the same position as when you jumped. Make first contact through your mid-foot (balls of your feet), rolling immediately back through you heels while initaiting a "hip-hinge" (bending at the hips, pushing your butt backwards) to absorb the impacting forces. Continue to drop into a 1/2 squat position bofre transitioning explosively into another diagonal jump.
Exercise Variation: Progress the drill intensity by jumping higher over the cones, spacing the cones further apart (4 - 6") or increasing the overal length of the grid. However, one set through the drills should not exceed 10 seconds (if performing at a 9 or 10-out-of-10 effort) or 15-20 yards for lower intensities.
Always learn the proper machanics of landing before jumping. Alignment of the foot, knee and ankle, and the mechanics of landing are critical to minimizing injury associated with jumping activities.

Step forward slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and press the left (stance / supporting) foot firmly into the ground to reduce any unwanted movement and maintain stability.

As you load your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (supporting) foot. While simultaneously lowering yourself into your right leg and hip, lift your hands holding the medicine ball straight overhead while continuing to maintain the abdominal bracing.
While in the bottom (downward) phase of the lunge, pull the medicine ball back down towards your chest, continue to maintain a stiff core and drive your right foot into the ground to extend the right knee and straighten the leg to return to the original (starting) position of standing with both feet under the hips and the ball held in front of the chest. Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.
Exercise Variation: Begin with a light-weight medicine ball in order to learn how to maintain stability all of the way through the movement. To increase the level of difficulty and to improve core and shoulder strength, once you can perform 8-12 repetitions on each leg, increase the weight of the medicine ball. Another option is to hold one dumbbell in each hand, start with the elbows bent at ninety degrees and tucked in to the side, at the bottom of the lunge, bend the elbows to bring the weight up to the shoulders and press it directly overhead.

Starting Position: Stand on the floor in an athletic ready position with both feet hip-width apart, position your body directly facing your partner (or wall / rebounder), your should be at least 5-8 feet away from your partner and each partner should maintain the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest lifted up, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised). Firmly hold a medicine ball between both hands right in front of your chest; contract and brace the abdominals and keep your hips pressed forward by contracting your glutes. Your head should be level and your eyes should be looking directly at the target.
The partner preparing to catch the medicine ball should stand with his or her feet firmly planted into the ground, the hips slightly flexed, the abdominals engaged and both hands held straight in front of the chest in order to provide a target for the partner throwing the ball. The person throwing the ball should step forward with the right foot into a forward lunge, as the right foot hits the ground bend your left knee to allow you to sink into your right hip simultaneously push the medicine ball away from your chest to throw it directly to your partner.
The partner catching the ball should catch it in a standing position with the arms outstretched straight out in front of his or her body, as the medicine ball hits the hands, allow it to decelerate towards the chest. Once the catching partner catches the medicine ball he or she should then step forward with the left leg into a forward lunge to throw the ball back to the partner who originated the throw who should be standing with the hips flexed, both feet hip width apart and the arms outstretched straight in front of his or her body to prepare to catch the ball.
The partner who originated the throwing should again step forward with his or her right leg into a forward lunge and throw the medicine ball back to the other person who is standing with outstretched hands prepared to catch the ball and step back into a forward lunge.
The partner catching the ball should first catch the ball with both hands and the feet hip width apart before stepping forward into a forward lunge with the left leg to throw another chest pass back to the partner who originated the lunging and throwing movement. Perform a number of lunge and throws stepping with one leg before alternating and conducting the same number of lunge and throws stepping forward with the other leg.
Exercise Variation: The partner catching the ball can balance on one leg to work on core stability while decelerating the forces related to catching the ball before stepping into the forward lunge.
During the entire thowing and catching sequence each partner should position his or her body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Each partner should keep his or her chest held up and out, the head in line with his or her spine and both hands out front while preparing to catch the ball (holding the hands in front of the body gives the partner throwing the ball a target to aim for when releasing the ball; the throwing partner should keep his or her eyes on the catching partner"s hands to ensure good aim).

Move the right foot to the right in order to plant it inside the agility ladder to begin the lateral and forward movements for the drill. The right foot should be planted inside the ladder, once the right foot is planted inside the ladder the left foot is brought in to the ladder and placed next to the right.
Keep the left foot planted inside the ladder and pick up the right foot to move it to the outside of the ladder, the right foot should be planted to the side and forward of the square where the left foot remains (the movement of the drill requires a zig-zag pattern which requires both lateral and forward movement).
Close-up: the left foot is on the outside of the ladder to push-off and the right foot is moved forward and to the right so that it can be placed and planted inside the ladder; when the right foot hits the ground, drop back into an athletic ready position and prepare to pick up the left foot to move it inside the ladder to place it next to the right.
Close-up: both feet are planted inside the ladder, maintain an athletic ready position with the hips flexed, spine straight and tall and the eyes looking straight ahead (not pictured).
Close-up: when both feet are next to each other in the square, pick up the right foot and plant it on the outside of the ladder in order to push off with right foot and pick up the left foot to move it forward to the next square in the ladder. The drill should create a zig-zag pattern which is a combination of both forward and lateral movement; the foot pattern is: in-in-out-in-in-out (right foot in the square-left foot in the square-right foot outside the square with the left foot picked up and moved forward to the next square, when it is on the ground the right foot is picked up from the outside of the square and brought into the square next to the left; the left foot is then planted on the outside of the square and the right foot moved forward to the next square).
Exercise Variation: When learning the drill, you can plant just one foot on the outside of the ladder, as you improve your skill and speed, you can bring both feet outside the ladder-plant the right foot, then bring the left foot outside the ladder to hit the ground next to the right before being moved to the next forward square. Another variation is to keep your eyes off of your feet and looking straight ahead where your opponent would be during an athletic competition.
Keep your hips flexed with a tall, straight spine to ensure the athletic position throughout the entire range-of-motion of the drill.

Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward and arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up. Shift your weight over your heels.
Ready Position: Maintaining abdominal bracing, bend the knees and hinge at the hips (shift hips back) bringing the torso forward. Allow the arms to flex (bend) at the elbow and remain close to your sides. Shift your weight to the balls of your feet.
Action: With the left leg, take a large step forward toward the cone into a lunge while simultaneously driving and extending the right arm forward and down, palms facing in, to the lightly touch the top of the come. Drive your left elbow backwards. The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.
Moving counter clockwise to the next cone (left front rotational), rotate to the left, pivoting off your right foot and lunging with your left leg aligning your feet and hips in the direction you are stepping (toward the cone). Follow the same technique as listed in step 3. Immediately push off your left foot and bring it back to center.
Continue counter clock-wise until you reach your starting point. Repeat the drill lunging forward with your right foot and moving clock-wise.
Exercise Variations: (1) Perform this drill extending the same side arm toward the cone. In this case, the opposite elbow would drive back behind the body. (2) Once you become comfortable with the oblique angle lunges, you can focus more on exploding to the cone. To increase the amount of explosion, widen the hexagon allowing you to take a couple steps forward then lunge to touch each cone. Placing a cone in the middle will provide a reference point.
It would be beneficial to practice the directional movements with stepping first to make sure your hip and foot alignment is correct before moving to the lunge. You may also have to adjust the size of the hexagon to a distance appropriate for you to perform the exercise correctly. Keep your arm movements strong and controlled.

Gently exhale and bend forward from your hips ("hip hinging"), keeping your knees extended (but not locked), and extend your arms in front of your body while slowly lowering your torso towards the floor until you can place your fingers or palms of your hands on the floor in front of your body. Maintaining a flat spine and a soft bend in your knees during this movement is acceptable.
Slowly begin to walk your hands forward (6-12” or 12 ½ - 25 cm steps) without moving your feet (your heels will begin to rise off the floor). Continue walking yourself forward until you reach a full-push-up position where your spine, hips and head are level with the floor (plank position).
Perform one full push-up, lowering your chest and hips simultaneously to the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor. Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.
Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. Continue pressing until the arms fully extend at the elbows. Slowly begin walking your feet forward towards your hands, taking 6-12” steps without moving your hands. Maintain a flat spine throughout and continue walking until your feet are close to your hands.
Repeat this movement and continue for 10 – 15 yards (9-13 m).
Exercise Variation: You can progress this exercise by adding multiple push-ups in the lowered position.
To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to monitor the position of your spine throughout the exercise. Focus on keeping your spine flat and avoid any rounding of your low back. Smaller steps help maintain correct body position. Reaching too far forward with your arms will put unnecessary stress on the shoulders.

Keep the right foot planted on the ground, (maintain balance through the movement by pressing the right foot into the ground while extending the leg and squeezing (contracting) both the thigh and glute muscles), lift the left knee so that it is straight in front of the hip and the hip is at a ninety degree angle. Bend the arms at ninety degree angles, as you raise the left knee, swing the right arm forward to flex the right shoulder while swinging left arm back to create shoulder extension.
Maintain the abdominal bracing to keep the core stiff and the spine straight, lean forward on the right hip while simultaneously extending the left hip behind your body, at the same time reach forward with the right arm to create right shoulder flexion and move the left elbow back to create left shoulder extension. Keep the right foot firmly planted into the ground to maintain balance and stability.
Continue flexing forward on the right hip (continue squeezing the right thigh and glutes to help maintain stability) while reaching forward with the left arm and extending the right leg backwards (into hip extension). To help maintain balance, find a spot on the floor and fix your gaze on that spot, this will create additional stability.
At the point where you feel your end range-of-motion while balanced on your right leg, reach forward with the left arm to fully extend the elbow while flexing the shoulder at the same time extend the left leg straight back to create full hip extension. Point the toes of the left foot towards the wall behind you in order to move into full extension of the left hip (and concurrent flexion of the right hip); continue to maintain abdominal bracing to ensure balance and stability. Try to keep the hips level and do not let the left hip drop towards the floor or roll away from the right (planted) leg. Hold this position for 3-5 seconds.
Maintain abdominal bracing and begin to lean back into the right hip while pulling the left hip forward (back into flexion) and the left arm back down towards your midsection. Return to an upright, standing position and repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time. Alternate legs and repeat for the same number of repetitions or period of time.
Exercise Variation: To add resistance and increase the level of difficulty, hold a dumbbell in your left hand (the weight should be in the hand opposite of the standing (balance) leg).
If balancing on the right leg, use the left leg to help move into a position of flexion on the right hip; pointing the left leg backwards while pointing the toes and straightening the legs will help move the right hip into a position of flexion.

Placement of a raised platform under the inside of the upper knee will help control this hip rotation. Additionally, avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening ("bracing") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.
Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. Hold this position briefly, then flex (bend) the elbow of the lower arm so that the back of the arm rests against the floor / mat, while the forearm is aligned vertically to the floor. Extend the other arm vertically towards the ceiling, but do not allow the scapula to move (i.e., hold it in the depressed and retracted position).
Gently exhale and while stabilizing your scapulae (shoulder blades), trunk and hips, perform a series of push-pull movements with your arms:
(a) Press the lower arm upwards, extending the elbow without allowing the scapula to move forward
(b) Pull the upper arm downwards towards the chest, flexing (bending) the elbow without allowing the scapula to move backwards.
Exercise Variation: The exercise intensity can be increased by using dumbbells.
To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapulae, trunk and hips and control movement at the shoulders. Follow the instructions provided carefully.

Gently contract your abdominal / core muscles ("bracing") to stiffen your torso and stabilize your spine, and depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back and maintain this shoulder position throughout the exercise.
Downward Movement: Inhale and press the right foot into the ground so your weight is balanced between the ball, heel and outside edge of the foot (keep the toes of the left foot on the floor for support during the entire range-of-motion of the exercise). Slowly begin to bend forward at the hips while maintaining the abdominal bracing to avoid shifting or rotation of your torso. Maintain a flat back and head alignment with your spine (or head extended slightly upwards).
Maintain a tall spine with the abdominals braced, push your weight back into your right hip while allowing the right knee to hinge, you can either hold your arms by your side (as pictured) or hold them out front as a counter-balance. As you are lowering yourself, maintain your weight through the ball of the foot and heel of the stance (supporting) foot, keep the pelvis level and the hips aligned during the full range-of-motion of the exercise.
Upward Movement: keep your bodyweight in your right leg and foot, exhale and slowly push the right foot into the ground to start moving upwards (by extending your hip and knee) to return to the initial standing position, maintain the core bracing through the entire movement to help keep the hips level and control balance.
Switch the stance (supporting) leg, and complete another set of repetitions on the other leg.
Exercise Variation: As this technique is mastered, the exercise intensity can be progressed by (1) lifting the supporting leg off of the floor. This increases the need for balance and stabilization within the body; (2) adding external resistance by holding a dumbbell in one hand or a medicine ball in both hands; (3) bending over and / or lower the hips closer to the ground increasing your knee bend; and (4) standing on unstable surfaces (e.g., Airex pad).

Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). At the same time press the backs of your lower legs and heels into the ball for additional stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back. Continue to press upwards until your legs and hips are straight with your torso and legs in alignment.
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly contract your hamstrings to move your heels towards your hips while plantar flexing (toes pointed away from your shines) your ankles to rest the soles of your feet on top of the ball.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode sideways (left) and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward, upward (towards an overhead position) and slightly sideways in your jumping direction during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.

Downward Phase: Each partner should start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Each partner should maintain a firm grip and allow each other to lean back slightly in order to be able to sink deeper into the hips for a greater range-of-motion.
Each person should continue to lower themself until their thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until their heels begin to lift off the floor, or until their torso begins to round or flex forward. Each person should monitor his or her feet, ankles and knees, to maintain control of their feet and knees each person should think about pushing the floor away from them while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as they return to a standing position.
Lowered Position: From the front, the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe, and body weight should be evenly distributed over both feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
Upward Phase: While keeping a firm grip on one another"s forearms, each person should maintain a straight trunk with a head-up position, and exhale while extending the hips and knees by pushing their feet into the floor through the heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Each person should continue extending his or her hips until returning to the starting position.
Exercise Variation: Each partner can place his or her feet in a split-squat position with the feet hip width apart and one foot slightly in front of the other. Each partner can balance on a single leg and perform a single leg squat, the act of the partners holding on to one another during the squatting movement will help to maintain the balance on one leg.

You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; lean forward to hinge at your hips with your knees slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability. You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) and the scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your heads in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised). Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing each other and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core.

When you and your partner have each extended (straightened) your arms, you should continue to maintain spinal stability while holding the arms in a straight line and pushing against the resistance.
You and your partner should simultaneously allow your right arm to flex (bend) slowly at the elbow working against and decelerating the pull of the resistance while holding the left arm in a straight line of elbow extension.
You and your partner should each simultaneously engage the upper muscles (triceps) of the right arm to push the resistance back while extending (straightening) the arm while simultaneously allowing the left arm to slowly flex (bend) at the elbow while working against the pull of the elastic resistance. Continue alternating the action of the arms; you and your partner should each hold your right arm in extension while bending and straightening the left arm, then alternate to hold the left arm straight in extension while bending and straightening the right arm.
Exercise Variation: To increase the intensity of the exercise, stand further away from your partner to create more resistance through the rubber resistance, or increase the speed (velocity) of the movement for enhanced power production and work-rate.
Remember to keep your feet planted into the floor with your abdominals engaged and contracted (braced) to ensure spinal stability.

Exercise Variation (1): Single-leg Calf Raise: From your starting position, bend your left knee to lift your left foot off the floor and perform single-leg calf raises. Repeat with your right leg. 2. Internal and External Foot Position: Turn your feet inward (to the 10 and 2 o"clock positions on a clock) or turn your feet outward (to the same clock positions) as a starting position and perform your calf raises with both feet or with a single-leg. Turning your feet inward places more emphasis on the medial (inner) muscles while turning your feet outward places more emphasis on the lateral (outer) muscles
Exercise Variation (2): Modified Internal and External Foot Position: Turn your feet inward (to 10 and 2 o"clock ) or turn your feet outward (to the same clock positions) and perform your calf raises with both feet or with a single leg. Turning your feet inward places more emphasis on the medial (inner) muscles while turning your feet outward places more emphasis on the lateral (outer) muscles.

Slowly exhale and initiate the downward pull by first depressing (lower) your scapulae, then pulling the bar downward towards the top or mid-section of your chest. Attempt to pull in a motion that drives your elbows directly down towards the floor, bringing your elbows towards the sides of your torso. Avoid any additional backwards lean during the pull movement.
Continue pulling until the bar nears or touches your chest, or more importantly, you observe your elbows no longer moving downward, but now beginning to move backwards. Avoid any further pulling as this places additiomnal stresses into the shoulder joint.
Pause momentarily, then slowly return to your starting position by allowing the bar to move upwards until your elbows are fully extended, then allow your scapule to rise slightly. Repeat the movement.
Exercise Variation: Perform the exercise in a standing position with your feet in a staggered-stace (walking position). Maintain a slight bend in your knees and shift your weight back onto your rear leg to create the backward lean. Avoid flexing (bending) forward at the hips during the pulling movement.
This exercise targets the major back muscles effectively, but should be performed without compromise to the shoulder or low back. Follow the instructions provided to reduce the stress placed upon these two areas.

Upward phase: Jump straight up into the air by explosively pushing your right foot in to the top of the box to create triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension) while simultaneously pushing off with your left foot and swinging your right arm up and in front of your body to help generate upward momentum. As you jump into the air lift up your left leg in order to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Mid-air: as you are in the air quickly swing your left leg forward and your right leg back so that you will land with your left foot on top of the platform and your right leg behind you on the floor.
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
Exercise Variation: When you are learning this exercise focus on the soft landing and reset your body in the correct position for the next jump and pause for a moment between jumps to ensure good form. As you improve minimize the rest time so that you are rapidly moving from one jump to the next.

Squat down by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees, as you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Brace your core to keep your trunk stable and spine straight. Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are near, or parallel with the floor, or until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Lift the end of the barbell and firmly grasp it in both hands using a closed grip (thumbs wrapped around the bar).

Maintain your body position with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). Keep your chest held up and out, head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised), heels on the floor, and shoulders over or slightly in front of the bar. Your eyes should be facing forward or slightly upward.
Upward phase: Push your feet into the ground and drive your hips forward to extend your legs and begin the upward phase of the movement by standing up while continuing to hold the end of the barbell in front of your chest. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees; to maintain control of your feet and knees push the floor away from you while keeping your knees aligned over the second toe of each foot as you move up to a standing position.
As you approach a full standing position quickly push through your heels, extending and pushing the hips towards an upright position, begin to press the end of the barbell upwards with both hands continuing to grip the end of the bar, stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine.
As the hips and knees reach full extension, continue pushing upward onto your toes at the ankle while pressing the bar overhead into full extension. The movement for the bar should start at the hips, travel through the trunk and continue through the shoulders and arms. Avoid arching your back during the overhead push. Roll up on your toes as you move your legs into triple extension (ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip extension).
Exercise Variation: Increase the velocity or speed of the movement to transition from a strength to a power-based exercise.

Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal, core and hip flexor muscles and slowly raise your hips off the mat, rolling your spine up as if trying to bring your knees towards your head (your hips and pelvis should move towards your rib cage). Avoid any change in the angle of your knees during the roll-up. Use your arms and hands to assist with maintaining your balance and continue to curl-up until your spine cannot roll any further. Hold this position briefly.
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your spine back towards the mat in a controlled fashion, moving your upper thighs backwards until they are positioned directly over your hips.

Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.

Continue to lower yourself until you feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing the BOSU directly and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity onto the top of the BOSU, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor, but bring them together to land on the top of the BOSU.
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase on a BOSU are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor.

Prepare for the jump by leaning forward hinging at the hips, while simultaneously keeping your weight back in your thighs, depressing and retracting your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Jumping Movement: Quickly sink your weight back into your hips then explosively push both feet into the floor and driving your hips forward to accelerate your body into the air achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously) in both legs. As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.

While you are in the air cycle your legs by moving your left leg forward in front of your body, your right leg backwards behind your body; cycle your arms with your legs so that as your left leg comes forward your right arm comes forward and as your right leg moves back your left arm moves back.
Downward phase: As you land your left leg should be in front of your body and your right leg back behind your body. The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries. Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
Exercise Variation: Be sure to alternate the forward leg, when learning this exercise focus first on landing with control and resetting before another repetition, as you improve your strength and power progress to performing multiple jumps in a row.
It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.

Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, then gently exhale and slowly bend forward from your hips, sliding your hands down your legs towards your ankles. Attempt to maintain a flat back position and avoid rounding your back towards the ceiling (i.e., move from the hips and not your low back). Keep your head aligned with your spine, knees extended and toes pointed upwards towards the ceiling. This should create a stretch through your calves and hamstrings, with some stretching in your low and middle back.
Continue to bend and reach forward to the point of tension in the stretch, but do not bounce or push to a point of pain. Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds, then relax by returning to your starting position and repeat 2-4 times. You may elect to grasp your ankles to hold this position.
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bounding, and control movement at other segments of the body. During this stretch, avoid any excessive rounding of your low back.

As your body lowers, the suspended leg will drive backwards, maintaining the 90 degree bend at the knee. Your right arm should drive forward from the shoulder towards the a end-position where the left arm started. Your left arm should simultaneously drive backwards to an end-position where the right arm started. Throughout the arm movements, squeeze the arms to the sides of your body and drive from the shoulders while maintaining the 90 degree bends. Continue to lower yourself maintaining weight over your left heel until your right thigh and torso are in parallel (form a straight line together). Your left tibia (shinbone) should move level with or slightly ahead of the ball of your left foot.
Upward Phase: Exhale and slowly press your body upwards by pushing down against the floor through your left heel. The muscle action at the knee and hips extend the body back to your starting position.
Exercise Variation (1): To increase the exercise intensity move more explosively to triple extension. The upward phase should be performed more explosively and incorporating triple extension (at the ankle, knee and hip).
Exercise Variation (2): To increase the exercise intensity move the upper extremity into different planes. While the lower extremity moves in the sagittal plane (front and back), the upper extremity and/or arms can move in the frontal (left and right) and transverse plane (rotation).

Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity over the top of the first cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees.
Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels to create a level foot, parallel with the floor. Always push your hips backwards and drop your hips to absorb the jumping forces. Avoid locking your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.
Land with your trunk inclined slightly forward, head aligned with your spine and back rigid or flat. Keep your abdominal / core muscles engaged, stiffening your torso to protect your spine.
With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your landing phase, explode forward and upwards again through your lower extremity over the second cone, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor. Continue this process until you have cleared all the cones.
Exercise Variation: As you develop your jumping and landing skills, you can progress the exercise intensity and complexity by: (1) driving your arms behind you during the downward phase, (2) driving your arms forward and upward (towards an overhead position) during the jumping phases, (3) driving your knees towards your chest during the jumping phases, (4) increasing the height of each cone or the spacing between each cone, or (5) moving back and forth more rapidly or adding more cones and performing a greater number of jumps in each direction.

Bring the left foot down and place it in the next square forward and explode into triple extension with the left leg while driving the right knee straight up; continue running forward down the ladder placing one foot in each square and emphasizing explosive leg action to rapidly move into triple extension each time you are pushing off and moving forward; keep your chest lifted, your spine straight and tall and use explosive arm swings to help maintain forward momentum through the course of the ladder.
Exercise Variation: Instead of placing one foot in each square, increase the leg action to place two feet in each square; maintain rapid arm action swinging the arms forward from the shoulder joint.

Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. Attempt to maintain this abdominal stiffness throughout the exercise.
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and the back of your left thigh; press your right foot into the ground and lift upwards off the floor into hip extension by contracting (squeezing) your right glute (butt muscle). At the same time press your right heel into the floor for more stability. Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position by controlling the action of the right hip. Repeat for a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time; then alternate legs.
Exercise Variation: To increase the strength of the muscles along the front of the shin (anterior tibilias) pick the toes of the right foot off of the floor to hold the foot in dorsiflexion-this is a good option for runners because it could help reduce the risk of developing shin splints.

Continue shifting your weight over the right foot until your tibia (shinbone) is vertical to the floor and your right knee is aligned directly over the second toe of your right foot. The goal is to sit deep into the lunge brining the glutes level with the right knee. Your left leg should be at full extension at the knee and your body weight should still be distributed into the right hip. The heels of both feet should stay flat on the floor. Push through your right heel and lift the left leg off the floor bringing it in to starting position.
Continue into the next over/under until you reach the end. Facing the same direction, come back down the line leading with your left foot.
When stepping over the broomstick, be sure not to step too wide to avoid contacting the broomstick with the extended leg. Contacting the broom stick a can cause it to move resulting in a loss of balance and injury. A common mistake when performing a body weight side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the tibia (shinbone) over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply shorten the width of the step taken to allow you to align the tibia over the placed foot.

Stand with the feet hip-width apart, the left foot slightly forward, the right foot slightly back while holding a medicine ball between both hands; contract and brace the abdominals while depressing and retracting your shoulder blades. Your eyes should be looking directly at the target in order to properly aim the throw.
Keep your feet pressed into the ground, continue to contract and brace your abdominal muscles, swing your arms upwards to lift the medicine ball overhead and bend your elbows to reach the medicine ball behind your head. As you lift the ball over your head, shift your weight back into your right leg and lean back to engage the core muscles for extra power for the throw. While preparing to throw the ball aim the throw by keeping your eyes on your partners hands as you pull the ball back over your head.
Explosively step forward with the right leg and quickly bring your arms forward over your head to generate power for throwing the ball. While stepping forward with the right leg, push the left leg into the ground create triple extension (ankle plantar flexion with knee and hip extension) and generate more forward momentum for the ball.
Exercise Variation: Repeating throws: Use a wall with a medicine ball capable of bouncing and position yourself so that you can throw the ball into the wall and quickly catch it to prepare for the next throw.

You and your training partner should stand facing each other with your feet hip-width apart and the right foot slightly in front of the left to create additional stability; your knees and hips should be slightly bent so that you each can sink into your hips and contract your abdominals (bracing) for additional stability. You and your partner should each position your body with the spine in neutral (normal-to-flat), shoulders depressed (no shrugging) with scapulae retracted (squeezing shoulder blades together). You and your partner should each keep your chest held up and out, with your head in line with your spine or slightly extended (raised). Grab the handles firmly in both hands and hold them so that your palms are facing the ground and pull back slightly to create opposing lines of pull.
You and your partner should each maintain an abdominal contraction with your feet planted on the floor to create stability through the hips and core. At the same time you and your partner should each pull back on the handles, the pulling motion should be initiated from the shoulder blades (which are rectraced), continue holding on to the handles but think about pulling from the elbows to engage the upper back and shoulder muscles.
Once you and your partner have pulled the handles back (into shoulder extension) you each should hold your shoulder blades retracted in an isometric contraction. With both arms held in an isometric contraction you and your partner should each allow your right arm to come forward in shoulder flexion (arm moving forward towards your training partner) while maintaining the left arm in a position of shoulder extension.
Once you and your partner have each allowed your right arm to move forward and pulled it back, you each should keep the right elbow next to the body with the right shoulder held in an isometric contraction (allowing no movement) while you each reach the left arm forward (the shoulder moves into flexion). Continue the abdominal bracing and alternate the arm movements, you and your partner should work together to provide resistance to one another while simultaneously pulling back on the bands to keep the tension.
Exercise Variation: Start with slow, steady consistent movements to become used to providing manual resistane through the tension of the rubber tubing; to increase the intensity you can either stand further away from each other to create additional tension on the rubber or increase the speed of the movement to make it more of a power-based exercise.

Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As you jump into the air, pull your knees up towards your chest and try to bring your heels right underneath your glute muscles; while in the air try to keep your feet level with each other and the bottoms parallel to the floor.
Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impact forces associated with jumping. Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine. Hold a medicine ball in front of your mid-section with a firm grip by both hands.
Step forward by slowly lifting the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the left (stance / supporting) leg. Maintain the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and keep the left (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The right (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the right (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the right leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the left (stance / supporting) foot.
As you lunge forward, focus more on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your left knee towards the heel of your right foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your left while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section.
From the lowered position, rotate back to the right so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the right foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the right knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously. As you are pulling yourself foward with the right leg, pick the left leg off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
While balancing on the right leg, step forward with the left foot off the floor, stabilize your body by maintaining the abdominal bracing in order to avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body. Keep the right (stance / supporting) foot pressed firmly in to the ground. The left (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the left (leading / forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you lower your bodyweight into the left leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the right (stance / supporting) foot.
As you continue into the next lunge with the left foot forward, keep the focus on lowering your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward, (think about aiming your right (back) knee towards the heel of your left (front) foot). This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your left (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously lean forward slightly at your hips while maintaining the adominal bracing to keep the spine extended and rotate to your right while continuing to hold the medicine ball in front of your mid-section.
From the lowered position, rotate back to the left so that you are facing straight ahead, firmly push the left foot in to the ground and pull yourself back to a standing position by drving the left knee straight back to create knee and hip extension simultaneously. As you are pulling yourself foward with the left leg, pick the right foot off of the ground and slowly swing it forward to initiate the next lunge.
Continue the walking lunge with rotation for a specific number of repetitions or a certain distance.
One variation is to contract the abdominals and glutes at the top of the stance phase (for example while balanced on the right leg with the left leg off of the ground) for 2-3 seconds to create a balance challenge. Another variation is to add more resistance by holding one dumbbell in each hand with the elbows bent at 90 degrees and pressed into the sides of the abdominals.

Stage One Starting Position (illustrated): Slowly rotate your arms with the medicine ball to the left, to a starting position high and behind you, but do not rotate your head, chest or torso. Your head, chest and hips should remain facing forward at all times throughout this exercise stage. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body.
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned near your right hip (performing a wood chop movement). Do not rotate your head, chest, torso or hips, and keep them facing forward. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body. Hold this end position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the movement in the opposite direction with your opposite leg forward.
Exercise Progression: Repeat the same movement, but extend your arms at the elbow and maintain this arm position throughout the wood chop movements. This longer lever increases the loading on the spine, requiring the core muscles to work harder
Stage Two Starting Position (not illustrated): Change your foot position to a stagger-stance by widening your base of support (moving feet wider apart). Assume the same starting position with your bent arms, but allow your hips to rotate to the left with your arms, increasing your degree of rotation. Your head, chest and torso should remain aligned over your hips. Much of your body weight should be loaded into your left leg.
Movement: Slowly, rotate your arms down and across your body to the right, while squatting down slightly to an end point where the medicine ball is positioned lower than your your right hip (performing a wood chop movement), and much of your weight has shifted over into the right leg. Rotate your hips, but keep your head, chest and torso aligned over your hips. Keep the medicine ball relatively close to your body.

Plant the right foot into the ground while simultaneously picking of the left foot to move to the left; when the right foot is on the ground in hip extension and the left foot is in the air to begin the movement to the left side, the left arm should be back in shoulder extension and the right arm forward in shoulder flexion.
Pushing off the right foot, shuffle to the left towards the cone placed approximately 5 yards to the left of the center cone; both feet should remain parallel and your body should maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips during the lateral shuffling motion.
At the left cone reach down with your left hand to touch the cone (this reach will ensure that you drop back into your hips); once you have touched the cone, drive the left foot into the ground and pick up the right foot to begin the lateral shuffling movement back to the right.
Maintain the athletic ready position with your weight back in your hips, your chest lifted tall with a straight spine and as you are shuffling to the right continue to pick up the right foot while driving off the left foot to maintain the momentum back to the cone placed 10 yards away (the right cone should be 5 yards from the center cone).
At the right cone reach down with the right hand to touch the cone, then drive the right foot into the ground and pick up the left foot in order to laterally shuffle back to the center cone; once at the center cone, drop back into the athletic ready position with the hips flexed and spine straight and tall and push the legs forward to move backwards in a backpedaling motion to return to the original starting position.
Exercise Variation: Have a partner or coach stand at the center cone and provide either verbal or visual instructions on which way to shuffle: either point to the left to have the athlete/client shuffle to the left, or provide a verbal cue of left to have the client/athlete move to the left.

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise. While holding a light dumbbell or weight in one hand, press that arm vertically while maintaining a neutral wrist (i.e., wrist aligned with your forearm) and scapula (shoulder blade) in contact with the mat. Place your opposite arm at the side of your body.
Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine and maintain this throughout the exercise. Gently exhale and rotate your trunk and legs slowly towards the arm placed at your side while keeping the extended arm vertical to the floor at all times and the upper shoulder stable (i.e., no movement of the shoulder blade). Continue to rotate until your belly button is level with the floor. This places a significant stretch and increased load into the upper shoulder. Control movement (stabilize) in this shoulder and avoid any arching in your low back that may accompany the rotation. Stiffening ("bracing") your abdominal muscles will help prevent this.
Pause momentarily then slowly return back to your starting position. Perform 1 set x 5 – 10 repetitions at a slow, controlled tempo (pace), then repeat to the opposite side.
Exercise Variation: If a light dumbbell is not available, perform this exercise without any resistance or with any weighted device. The exercise complexity is increased by holding a kettle bell that has an “offset center of mass.”
To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stabilize the scapula and control movement carefully. Follow the instructions provided carefully

In preparation to step forward, slowly lift the right foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
As you lower yourself forward into the lunge position, maintain the abdominal bracing and focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your right (front) thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While in the lunge position simultaneously bend forward at your hips, while maintaining a flat back and contracting (squeezing) the glutes of the left (backward) leg, this will help increase the stretch in the left hip flexor muscles.
Hold this stretch position for 15-30 seconds at a time for a total of 2-4 repetitions; try to move into the stretch a little deeper with each repetition, but be sure to keep your body in alignment. Complete all repetitions on one side before alternating to the other leg.

To start the exercise, initiate a Hollowing Movement: Breathe normally and at the end of your breaths (end-tidal volume), perform the following actions individually at first, then combine them together:
Once you have used a hollowing movement to stabilize your spine and pelvis, lift both legs and arms off of the floor; the knees should be directly over the hip joints and bent ninety degrees (pictured) and the elbows should be directly over the shoulder joints so your hands are pointed over your head (pictured).
Inhale and maintain the abdominal hollowing while slowly lowering the right heel and left hand towards the floor. The hand and heel should lightly touch the floor (but not rest), exhale continue the abdominal hollowing and slowly bring the leg and arm back to the initial starting position. Alternate to use the right arm and left leg; continue to complete a specific number of repetitions or a certain period of time.
Exercise Variation: To have more control (making it easier) when learning this exercise, start with the hands resting on the floor above the head and the feet resting gently on the floor in front of the buttocks; slowly lift the right arm and left leg off of the floor together while maintaining the abdominal hollowing, lower and alternate sides.

Extend your arms outwards at shoulder level with palms facing upwards and stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.
Gently exhale and extend your leg slowly by contracting your quads while pulling your toes downwards towards your body, this will increase the stretch in your hamstrings and calf muscles. Do not allow any movement in your hips and low back during this stretch.
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position. Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then change your position and repeat with the opposite leg.
Exercise Variation: Progress this by tilting your pelvis (hips) anteriorly (forward) to increase the stretch within the hamstrings. While in the stretched position with your knee extended and toes pulled downwards, increase the arch in your lower back, which tilts your hips forward and increases the magnitude of the hamstrings stretch.
This stretch with pelvic tilts can be completed more dynamically by completing 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the tilted position for 1 - 2 seconds.
To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and perform the pelvic tilting movement slowly.

Upon placing your outer leg, firmly on the floor, drop once again into a wide-stance squat position (mechanics are similar to regular squat), lowering your body to a comfortable depth or until your thighs lie parallel to the floor and your body weight rests on your heels.
Repeat this movement in one direction or stopping to turn back towards your starting position.
Exercise Variation: The dynamic balance challenge to the body can be increased in this exercise by: (1) Pivoting faster without losing postural control (balance) or (2) pivoting with a backward rotation off the other foot rather than pivoting in a forward rotation.

Slowly lift both feet off the floor moving your knees towards your trunk until your thighs align vertically to the floor (90-degree angle at the hips). Maintain a 90-degree bend at the knee and relax your feet, allowing them to point away from your body.
Gently exhale then begin your movement by simultaneously:
Continue moving until your elbow touches or comes close to touching the opposite knee. Hold this up-position briefly for 1 – 2 seconds then slowly return to your starting position and repeat the movement to the opposite side. Complete a set of quality reps until your experience fatigue or until your technique (form) becomes compromised.
Important points to consider while performing this movement:
To maximize the benefits of this exercise and reduce the potential for injury, it is important to control movement speed and monitor changes in your low back carefully.

Stiffen (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise. Place the heel of one foot on top of the toes of the other foot, aligning both feet vertically.
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your hips, attempting to drop the inside of the top foot towards the floor while keeping both knees extended. Attempt to rotate the hips until they align vertically, or near vertically with the floor with little rotation occurring through your trunk. Avoid arching your low back during this rotation.
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position. Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then change your foot position and repeat with the opposite side.
Exercise Variation: This stretch can become more dynamic by performing slow, controlled movements to complete 1 set of 5 - 10 repetitions with each leg, holding the stretched position for 1 - 2 seconds.
To maximize the benefits of a stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to stretch only to the point of tension, avoid bouncing and control movement at other segments of the body. During this stretch, attempt to avoid any rotation or arching in your low back

INSERT INTO exercise_description VALUES (1329, 'Starting Position: Lie on your side on a mat with both legs bent slightly deeper than 90 degrees at the hips, knees bent to 90 degrees, and feet overlapping each other. Align your hips and shoulder vertically with the floor and spine and head in a straight line. Extend your lower arm in front of your body at chest level, resting it upon the mat while reaching with your upper arm down under your trunk to firmly grasp your ribcage. Contract (“brace”) your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine, depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) without moving your trunk and attempt to hold these positions throughout the exercise.
Gently exhale and slowly rotate your trunk by pulling the ribcage around with your upper arm. Attempt to avoid any rotation of your hips, (indicated by your upper thigh sliding backwards as you rotate). Continue rotating your trunk until your reach the point of tension, avoid bouncing or pushing to the point of pain. The deeper bend at the hips and abdominal stiffening will help prevent any arching in your low back during the stretch. Grasping under your ribcage will ensure rotation, and stretching of, your trunk and reduce shoulder stress that often occurs when the arm is extended and allowed to fall towards the floor (refer progression).
Hold this position for 15 – 30 seconds then relax and return to your starting position. Perform 2 – 4 repetitions then repeat to the opposite side.
Progression 1: Extend the lower leg, while resting the inside of the upper knee on a small riser. In this position, the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk, evidenced by a backwards slide of the upper knee during the rotation. Your objective is to stabilize your hips while only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.
Progression 2: Remove the riser under the upper knee and place it firmly against the mat / floor. In this position, the upper knee may rise off the floor and the upper thigh may rotate with your trunk. Your objective is to stabilize your hips by pressing the knee into the floor and only allowing rotation to occur in the trunk.
Progression 3: Repeat the same exercise, but begin with both arms extended in front of your body at chest level. As you begin to rotate, bend the upper elbow, sliding it towards your trunk, then extending the arm outwards again at chest level as you continue your rotation. Continue your rotation until the point of tension in the trunk and shoulder, but avoid arching your back or rotating your hips. This will increase the stretch in the shoulder and chest region, in addition to your trunk.
To maximize the benefits of this stretch and reduce the potential for injury, it is often important to follow the instructions provided carefully.
