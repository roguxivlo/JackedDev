# JackedDev
JackedDev is a databases course project developed in collaboration with
Mateusz Mroczka [@MMusername](https://github.com/MMusername). The site contains
several hundred gym exercises with data such as tips on technique, worked muscle groups,
difficulty and required equipment.

It enables users to create their account and keep track of their progress by adding
their trainings.

The site is up and working [here](https://students.mimuw.edu.pl/~mm439937/bd/)
